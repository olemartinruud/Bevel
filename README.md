A super awesome LightDM Webkit greeter theme.

This is a fork of Blender3D's excellent theme. At the moment my changes amount
to a few simple bugfixes and a restructuring of the javascript which provides
the theme's functionality. I have vague plans to improve the theme further.

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository into /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/bevel
2. Set the theme in /etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf
3. ~~Set your default session in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, as currently this
   theme does not have any kind of a session chooser.~~ I fixed this!

Obviously you'll need lightdm and lightdm-webkit-greeter.
